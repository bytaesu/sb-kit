### Bring Your Own Client

sb-kit doesn’t create its own Supabase client. Instead, it’s designed to work with the client instance provided by your application, giving you full control over how it’s configured.

This means you can continue using all Supabase features through your client, in addition to what sb-kit provides.

### Centralized Configuration

Integrating Supabase Auth with Next.js usually means writing scattered setup code across multiple files. sb-kit centralizes everything into a single configuration file, making it easier to manage and update.

### Ready to Use

Supabase offers powerful customization options, but sometimes you just need auth that works out of the box. sb-kit provides common auth UI patterns and logic you can drop in and start using right away.

### Open Source

You can find the source code and example application at https://github.com/bytaesu/sb-kit. sb-kit is released under the MIT license. Feel free to use it, and if you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, contributions are always welcome!
